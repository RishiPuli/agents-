      "It seems there might be a slight misunderstanding in your question. **FastAPI** is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python. **REST API** (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is an architectural style for designing networked applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can't directly compare FastAPI and REST API as \"better\" because they operate at different levels:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **FastAPI is a tool (a framework) you use to *build* APIs, and it strongly encourages building RESTful APIs.**\n",
      "*   **REST API is a set of principles and constraints for how an API should be designed and behave.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the question is more accurately phrased as: **\"Is FastAPI a good choice for building REST APIs?\"**\n",
      "\n",
      "The answer to that is a resounding **yes**.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let's break down why FastAPI is an excellent choice for building REST APIs and what makes it stand out:\n",
      "\n",
      "### Why FastAPI is Great for Building REST APIs\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Performance:** FastAPI is built on top of Starlette (for web handling) and Pydantic (for data validation). This combination leads to extremely high performance, often on par with Node.js and Go. This is crucial for APIs that need to handle a large number of requests.\n",
      "\n",
      "    ```python\n",
      "    # Example: A simple FastAPI endpoint\n",
      "    from fastapi import FastAPI\n",
      "\n",
      "    app = FastAPI()\n",
      "\n",
      "    @app.get(\"/\")\n",
      "    async def read_root():\n",
      "        return {\"Hello\": \"World\"}\n",
      "    ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Ease of Use & Developer Experience:** FastAPI is designed to be intuitive and easy to learn. Its syntax is clean and Pythonic.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Automatic Data Validation with Pydantic:** This is a killer feature. You define your data structures using Python type hints, and Pydantic handles the validation, serialization, and deserialization of requests and responses. This significantly reduces boilerplate code and prevents common errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "    ```python\n",
      "    from fastapi import FastAPI\n",
      "    from pydantic import BaseModel\n",
      "\n",
      "    app = FastAPI()\n",
      "\n",
      "    class Item(BaseModel):\n",
      "        name: str\n",
      "        price: float\n",
      "        is_offer: bool | None = None # Optional field\n",
      "\n",
      "    @app.post(\"/items/\")\n",
      "    async def create_item(item: Item):\n",
      "        return item\n",
      "    ```\n",
      "    When a request comes in to `/items/` with invalid data (e.g., `price` as a string), FastAPI will automatically return a 422 Unprocessable Entity error with clear details.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Automatic API Documentation (Swagger UI & ReDoc):** Based on your code and Pydantic models, FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation. This is incredibly useful for developers consuming your API.\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Swagger UI:** Accessible at `/docs` by default.\n",
      "    *   **ReDoc:** Accessible at `/redoc` by default.\n",
      "\n",
      "    This means you don't have to manually write and maintain API documentation.\n",
      "\n",
      "    ```python\n",
      "    # The previous examples automatically generate documentation.\n",
      "    # No extra code needed for this!\n",
      "    ```\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Asynchronous Support (async/await):** FastAPI fully embraces Python's asynchronous capabilities. This allows for highly concurrent operations, especially beneficial when dealing with I/O-bound tasks like database queries or external API calls.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.  **Dependency Injection:** FastAPI has a powerful and easy-to-use dependency injection system. This makes it simple to manage dependencies like database connections, authentication handlers, or configuration settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "    ```python\n",
      "    from fastapi import FastAPI, Depends\n",
      "\n",
      "    def get_db():\n",
      "        db = {\"users\": [\"Alice\", \"Bob\"]}\n",
      "        return db\n",
      "\n",
      "    app = FastAPI()\n",
      "\n",
      "    @app.get(\"/users/\")\n",
      "    async def read_users(database: dict = Depends(get_db)):\n",
      "        return database[\"users\"]\n",
      "    ```\n",
      "\n",
      "7.  **Type Hinting:** FastAPI leverages Python's standard type hinting extensively. This improves code readability, maintainability, and allows for static analysis tools to catch errors.\n",
      "\n",
      "### REST API Principles (What FastAPI helps you achieve)\n",
      "\n",
      "When building an API with FastAPI, you're typically aiming for a RESTful design. REST APIs are characterized by:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Client-Server Architecture:** Separation of concerns.\n",
      "*   **Statelessness:** Each request from a client to a server must contain all the information needed to understand and complete the request. The server should not store any client context between requests.\n",
      "*   **Cacheability:** Responses must define themselves as cacheable or non-cacheable.\n",
      "*   **Uniform Interface:** A consistent way of interacting with resources. This includes:\n",
      "    *   **Identification of resources:** Using URIs (e.g., `/users/123`).\n",
      "    *   **Manipulation of resources through representations:** Using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and data formats (JSON, XML).\n",
      "    *   **Self-descriptive messages:** Requests and responses contain enough information to be understood.\n",
      "    *   **Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS):** (Less commonly strictly enforced, but the idea is that responses can contain links to related actions/resources).\n",
      "\n",
      "FastAPI makes implementing these principles straightforward through its routing, request handling, and response formatting capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "You don't choose between FastAPI and REST API. **You use a framework like FastAPI to build a REST API.**\n",
      "\n",
      "**FastAPI is an excellent, modern, and high-performance choice for building RESTful APIs in Python**, offering significant advantages in terms of developer experience, performance, data validation, and automatic documentation.\n"

      "\n",
      "*   **Counting:** Imagine you have two objects (like apples). Then, you add two more apples. If you count them all together, you'll find you have four apples.\n",
      "*   **Number Line:** On a number line, if you start at the number 2 and move 2 units to the right (representing adding 2), you will land on the number 4.\n",
      "*   **Set Theory:** In set theory, you can think of it as combining two sets of elements. If you have a set with 2 elements and another set with 2 elements, and you combine them into a single set, the new set will have 4 elements.\n",
      "*   **Peano Axioms (more advanced):** For those interested in the formal mathematical underpinnings, addition is defined based on the successor function. The successor of a number is the next number in the sequence. So, 2 is the successor of 1, and 4 is the successor of 3. Adding 2 to 2 means finding the successor of the successor of 2.\n",
      "    *   Successor of 2 is 3.\n",
      "    *   Successor of 3 is 4.\n",
      "    Therefore, 2 + 2 = 4.\n",

It\\'s renowned for its complex narrative, mind-bending visuals, and exploration of dreams and reality.\\n\\nHere are the key details of the movie:\\n\\n**Logline:** A skilled thief who steals information by entering people\\'s dreams is offered a chance to have his criminal history erased in exchange for a seemingly impossible task: planting an idea into a target\\'s subconscious.\\n\\n**Synopsis:**\\n\\nThe story centers on **Dominick \"Dom\" Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio)**, a highly skilled \"extractor\" who specializes in entering people\\'s dreams to steal valuable information. He operates in a world where technology allows for shared dreaming, and extracting secrets from the subconscious is a dangerous but lucrative business.\\n\\nHowever, Cobb is a fugitive, unable to return to his children in the United States. He is approached by **Saito (Ken Watanabe)**, a powerful businessman who offers Cobb a deal: perform \"inception\" – planting an idea into someone\\'s mind rather than stealing one. If successful, Saito will clear Cobb\\'s criminal record, allowing him to go home.\\n\\nThe target is **Robert Michael Fischer Jr. (Cillian Murphy)**, the heir to a vast energy empire. The idea to be planted is for Fischer to break up his father\\'s company. This is an incredibly difficult feat, as the subconscious mind is designed to reject foreign ideas.\\n\\nTo achieve this, Cobb assembles a specialized team:\\n\\n*   **Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt):** Cobb\\'s point man, responsible for research and organization.\\n*   **Ariadne (Elliot Page):** A talented architecture student who designs the dreamscapes.\\n*   **Eames (Tom Hardy):** A skilled impersonator who can adopt the appearance of others within the dream.\\n*   **Yusuf (Dileep Rao):** A chemist who creates powerful sedatives for deep, multi-layered dreaming.\\n\\nThe team embarks on a dangerous mission that involves navigating multiple layers of dreams, each deeper and more unstable than the last. As they descend into Fischer\\'s subconscious, they encounter projections of Cobb\\'s deceased wife, **Mal (Marion Cotillard)**, who actively sabotages their efforts and represents Cobb\\'s guilt and unresolved trauma.\\n\\nThe film explores themes of:\\n\\n*   **The nature of reality vs. dreams:** The blurring lines between what is real and what is dreamt.\\n*   **Memory and guilt:** Cobb\\'s struggle with the loss of his wife and his role in her death.\\n*   **The power of ideas:** How a single idea can shape a person\\'s entire life.\\n*   **Trust and betrayal:** The dynamics within the team and the potential for sabotage.\\n\\n**Key Characters:**\\n\\n*   **Dominick \"Dom\" Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio):** The protagonist, a troubled extractor haunted by his past.\\n*   **Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt):** Cobb\\'s pragmatic and organized partner.\\n*   **Ariadne (Elliot Page):** The architect of the dream worlds, a newcomer to the extraction business.\\n*   **Eames (Tom Hardy):** A charismatic and resourceful forger.\\n*   **Robert Michael Fischer Jr. (Cillian Murphy):** The target of the inception.\\n*   **Saito (Ken Watanabe):** The wealthy businessman who hires Cobb.\\n*   **Mal (Marion Cotillard):** Cobb\\'s deceased wife, a powerful projection within the dreams.\\n*   **Peter Browning (Tom Berenger):** Fischer\\'s mentor and a potential obstacle.\\n*   **Maurice Fischer (Pete Postlethwaite):** Fischer\\'s dying father, whose will is central to the plot.\\n\\n**Notable Aspects:**\\n\\n*   **Dream Layers:** The film features multiple nested dream levels, each with its own rules and time dilation.\\n*   **\"Kick\":** A jolt or shock that wakes a dreamer up from a particular dream level. A kick in one level can affect higher levels.\\n*   **Totems:** Small, personal objects that extractors use to distinguish dream from reality. Cobb\\'s totem is a spinning top.\\n*   **Visual Effects:** The film is celebrated for its groundbreaking visual effects, particularly the bending cities, collapsing hotel corridors, and zero-gravity fight sequences.\\n*   **Musical Score:** Hans Zimmer\\'s iconic and intense score plays a crucial role in building tension and atmosphere.\\n\\n**Themes and Interpretations:**\\n\\n\"Inception\" is known for its ambiguous ending, leaving audiences to debate whether Cobb ultimately returns to reality or remains trapped in a dream. This ambiguity is a deliberate choice by Nolan, inviting viewers to consider the subjective nature of their own realities.\\n\\n**Critical Reception and Legacy:**\\n\\n\"Inception\" was a massive critical and commercial success. It received widespread praise for its originality, directing, screenplay, visual effects, and performances. It was nominated for eight Academy Awards, winning four, including Best Visual Effects and Best Cinematography. The film has had a lasting impact on popular culture, influencing subsequent films and inspiring discussions about dreams and consciousness.\\n\\nIf you\\'re looking for a thought-provoking, action-packed, and visually stunning cinematic experience, \"Inception\" is a must-watch.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'model_name': 'gemini-2.5-flash-lite', 'safety_ratings': [], 'model_provider': 'google_genai'}, id='lc_run--019c0463-33f8-75b1-9ee8-505486bdb559-0', tool_calls=[], invalid_tool_calls=[], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 10, 'output_tokens': 1111, 'total_tokens': 1121, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}})"
